<p>In the notes, we worked an example where the potential along the x-axis is zero and the potential in the x-direction at <span class="math inline">\(y=a\)</span> is also zero, but the potential along <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(y=0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y=a\)</span> was a constant <span class="math inline">\(\phi_0\)</span>. For this problem, change the potential along the back wall from a single constant, to two constants, so that the potential from <span class="math inline">\(y=0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y=a/2\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\phi_0\)</span> and the potential from <span class="math inline">\(y=a/2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y=a\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(-\phi_0\)</span>. Also plot the first several terms of this in Mathematica and do a version of this in Excel with the relaxation method and plot that as well.</p>
<h2 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h2>
<p>A rectangular pipe runs along the z-axis. Three of its sides are maintained at <span class="math inline">\(\phi = 0\)</span> (so they are grounded): <span class="math inline">\(y=0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y=a\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>. The fourth side at <span class="math inline">\(x=b\)</span> is a constant potential <span class="math inline">\(\phi_0\)</span>. What is a general expression for the potential inside the pipe? Plot several terms of this in Mathematica and build an Excel model and plot that as well.</p>
<h2 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h2>
<p>A cubical box with side lengths <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> has a 5 sides that are grounded, but the top side is maintained at constant potential <span class="math inline">\(\phi_0\)</span>. What is a general expression for the potential inside the box?</p>
<h2 id="problem-4">Problem 4</h2>
<p>A sphere has two separate potentials maintained on different hemispheres. On the north hemisphere, the potential is <span class="math inline">\(\phi_0\)</span> while on the south hemisphere the potential is 0. Find an expression for the potential inside the sphere.</p>

<h3 id="problem-5">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Find the potential inside a sphere that has a potential on the surface of <span class="math inline">\(V_0\cos^4(\theta)\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="problem-6">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Same as above but now the potential on the surface is <span class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;\theta&lt;\pi/3\)</span> and 0 otherwise.</p>
