In the notes, we worked an example where the potential along the x-axis is zero and the potential in the x-direction at $y=a$ is also zero, but the potential along $x=0$ from $y=0$ to $y=a$ was a constant $\phi_0$. For this problem, change the potential along the back wall from a single constant, to two constants, so that the potential from $y=0$ to $y=a/2$ is $\phi_0$ and the potential from $y=a/2$ to $y=a$ is $-\phi_0$. Also plot the first several terms of this in Mathematica and do a version of this in Excel with the relaxation method and plot that as well.

\item
For the first example problem (which I also referenced in the previous problem), what would be the surface charge density $\sigma$ of the back plate assuming it was a conductor maintained at a the uniform potential of $\phi_0$?

\item
A rectangular pipe runs along the z-axis. Three of its sides are maintained at $\phi = 0$ (so they are grounded): $y=0$, $y=a$, and $x=0$. The fourth side at $x=b$ is a constant potential $\phi_0$. What is a general expression for the potential inside the pipe? Plot several terms of this in Mathematica and build an Excel model and plot that as well.

\item
A cubical box with side lengths $a$ has a 5 sides that are grounded, but the top side is maintained at constant potential $\phi_0$. What is a general expression for the potential inside the box?
